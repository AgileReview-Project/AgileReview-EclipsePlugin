	<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
	<h3>What are the minimal system requirements to run AgileReview?</h3>
	<p>
        The plugin has been tested with the following Eclipse versions:
		<ul>

	</p>
	
	<h3>Why is the project named AgileReview?</h3>
<p>The project was named AgileReview as reviews can be done in a fast, flexible way which was summarized in the word agile. This has nothing to do with Agile Software Developement.</p>
<h3>Where is the review data saved? How can I share it?</h3>
<p>The review data is saved as a project in your Eclipse workspace. It contains all reviews and comments. You can share it via your version control system. Also you can checkout review data of e.g. colleagues to join reviews.<p>
<h3>What are Smart Suggestions?</h3>
<p>Smart Suggestions provide you with previously entered values for common data fields such as comment recipient.</p>
<h3>Why can't I review files using specific editors?</h3>
<p>At the moment only single-page text editors (such as Java editor or plain text editor) are supported. Support for other (also multi-page) editors will be included in future releases.</p>
<h3>Which template should I use for the review export?</h3>
<p>The template should be an instantiation of the provided raw templates in the download section. You can implement some more analytical functionalities for your export template. The only constraint is, that the first four excel sheets should not be changed to guaranty a successful export with AgileReview.</p>
