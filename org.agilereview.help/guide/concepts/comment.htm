  code of a file that is part of a project of the Eclipse workspace. It is 
  related to exactly one file and exactly one review. A comment consists of the 
  following information:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><b>ID</b> - the comment's ID (unique in context of an author and a review)</li>
    <li><b>Author</b> - the comment's author</li>
    <li><b>Status</b> - the comment's actual status (open, closed)</li>
    <li><b>Priority</b> - the comment's priority (high, medium, low)</li>

    <li><b>Description</b> - a short description of the issue marked by this comment</li>
    <li><b>Replies</b> - a list of replies that were added by the author and other reviewers</li>
   </ul>
